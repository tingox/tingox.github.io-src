I should check out [Landslide][1], [Marp][2], [pandoc][3], [Hacker Slides][4] and other Markdown-powered slide generators.
Not my idea, I read the article [4 Markdown-powered slide generators](https://opensource.com/article/18/5/markdown-slide-generators) by Scott Nesbitt. All inspiration comes from there.

Landslide is (mostly) Python which is nice. Marp is an [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) app, so a bit "heavier" on requirements, pandoc looks complicated, and Hacker Slides is an app for [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/) and [Sandstorm Oasis](https://oasis.sandstorm.io/) so "heavy" again.

This article is the first on this blog written and published from my FreeBSD workstation, I just installed Pelican and cloned the github repo. It works in the same way as on Linux, except that I use 'gmake' instead of 'make'. Nice!
