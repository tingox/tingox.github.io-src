I find it interesting that we now have [Anbox][1] and [Darling][2] in addition to [Wine][3]. I have used Wine successfully in the past, even with a usb label printer once
(which didn't follow the usb specification well and misbehaved under Linux and *BSD). Today, the only Windows applications I need are badly behaved and don't work in Wine, or they
require contact with a physical device (usb or otherwise) and that part doesn't work in Wine.

So far, I have no need for macOS applications, and no need to run Android apps outside of an Android device.
