For some reason, the simple theme was broken, at least on my machine. So I downloaded [pelican-themes][1] and changed to the tuxlite_tbs theme. Also, I need to set ${EDITOR} on my machine. Broken seems to be a theme here...

Update: but now I need to do `cd ..; git clone --recursive https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes` on every machine I will post from. Hmm...
