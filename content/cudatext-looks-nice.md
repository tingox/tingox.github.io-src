[CudaText](http://uvviewsoft.com/cudatext/) looks nice. A lot of features, and written in Pascal too. If I set $EDITOR correctly, it will let me
edit my blog posts too, directly from the Makefile. Perhaps I should spend some time learning it.

Ok, middle button (mouse) paste doesn't work out iof the box, instead it does something with the scroll wheel. I need to change that.
