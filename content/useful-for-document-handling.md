Often I find articles about useful tools online, that I need to find back to later. [Page dewarping](https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/15/page-dewarping.html) by Matt Zucker (code on [Github][1]) is one such article. It will be useful for scanning old documentation.
His [noteshrink][2] tool and [Compressing and enhancing hand-written notes][3] article is also interesting, perhaps I can shrink  some of the scanned PDF files.
