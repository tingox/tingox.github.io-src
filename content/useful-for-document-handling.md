Often I find articles about useful tools online, that I need to find back to later. [Page dewarping](https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/15/page-dewarping.html) by Matt Zucker (code on [Github][1]) is one such article. It will be useful for scanning old documentation.
His [noteshrink][2] tool and [Compressing and enhancing hand-written notes][3] article is also interesting, perhaps I can shrink  some of the scanned PDF files.

It seems like the [Archivist][4] still is the choice for a DIY book scanner - it is easy to understand why, a lot of thought has been put into the design. I wonder if it is possible to create something more portable?
The [auto page flip scanner][9] thread in the forum is also interesting.
On the software side, some useful tools are [Pi Scan][5], [ScanTailor Advanced][6]

Hmm, what about [SpreadPi][7] / [Spreads][8]? Does Pi Scan replace them? Or are they still useful?

Lots of info over at the [DIY Book Scanner][11] [forums][10].
