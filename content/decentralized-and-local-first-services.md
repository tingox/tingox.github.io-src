The article [Run your own social](https://runyourown.social/) which I found via [BoingBoing][1] is interesting. If you put the question of why anyone would want another time-thief in their life (yes, a new service will come as an addition, not as a replacement) it explains a way to do it, not only the technical issues, but what it requires of effort in other areas too.

One of the sources / inspirations is the [Local-first software][2] article. The authors have built some interesting prototypes based on conflict-free replicated datatype or [CRDT][3] that shows that distributed tools are possible without using hosted or centralized servers.
