Alternatives to Github, some offer a hosted experience, some requires self-hosting. Check out [Gitea][1] which requires Go, [GitLab][2], [Bitbucket][3] by Atlassian, [GitPrep][4] which calls itself a Github clone, [Kallithea][5], [Phabricator][6] which is used by FreeBSD among others. There are probably more as well.
