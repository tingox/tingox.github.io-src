There are two slightly different git "cheat sheets" that you can download from Github, one [blue](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) and 
one [green](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) in color. The blue one refers to Github Training while the green one refers to Github Education.
Also, contents and wording is slightly different between them. Still, they are both useful.
