This is just the second blog post. The inspiration for doing this came from this [article][1]. Other options for static
website generators are [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) written in Ruby, [Hyde](http://hyde.github.io/) written in Python, 
[Hexo](https://hexo.io/) written in Javascript (nodeJS), [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) written in Go, 
[Cactus](https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus) written in Python and using Django, [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) 
in Python and using Jinja2, [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) written in Python and using [rST][2] as markup language,
[Nikola](https://www.getnikola.com/) written in Python it uses rST as default markup, but supports many more. It also has 
a [plugin][3] for Mediawiki markup. Lots more on [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/).

Hmm, it looks like Lektor also has support for Github pages.
